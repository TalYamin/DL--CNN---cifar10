# DL-CNN-cifar10

This project target was to explore convolution networks and the effects of their architecture on accuracy. 
I implemented a common block-based deep CNN pattern and I performed various experiments on it while varying the architecture. 
Then I implemented my own custom architecture to see whether we can get high classification results on CIFAR-10.
